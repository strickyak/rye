"""
The MD5 cryptographic hash algorithm.

Class md5 computes MD5 hashes.
In this minimal implementation, the string to be
hashed must be passed to the construtor.
The object cannot be updated.
The only method on the object is hexdigest().

Globals:
  blocksize = 1     # It works on individual bytes.
  digest_size = 16  # The digest is 16 bytes.
  new = md5         # new is an alias for md5.
